# DELTA-PIGEON-FURKA-TALE

**A narrative-driven RPG crafted by a duo — where two souls share one body, one fate.**

After a tragic accident, you awaken as **Furka**, kept alive only by a donated body. But the donor's consciousness, **Pigeon**, never left. Now, bound together in a single form, you must navigate a world shrouded in mystery and confront an ancient force that seeks to unravel reality itself.

Explore, battle, and survive through intertwined destinies. Can two souls in one body unite to save everything?
